# Wrapper Classes in Java
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types. When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store a primitive data types. In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

# Need of Wrapper Classes
<br>They convert primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed if we wish to modify the arguments passed into a method (because primitive types are passed by value).
<br>The classes in java.util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes help in this case also.
<br>Data structures in the Collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects (reference types) and not primitive types.
<br>An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.
